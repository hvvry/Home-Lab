# Home Lab

## Objective

By creating a personal homelab, I'm exploring cybersecurity technology from the ground up. I used VirtualBox for virtualized infrastructure, including Windows Server 2019 for essential services, Kali Linux for offensive security, and a Windows 10 VM domain-joined to the domain controller. Security monitoring utilizes Sysmon for logging on Windows 10, complemented by Splunk as SIEM for log analysis. My aim was to replicate real threats, enhancing understanding of security nuances, attack vectors, and defense mechanisms.

### Skills Learned
- Installing and configuring a domain controller and DNS server.
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.

## Steps
TBD
